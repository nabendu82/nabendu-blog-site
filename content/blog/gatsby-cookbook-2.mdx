As many of my readers know from my previous [post](https://thewebdev.tech/gatsby-cookbook-1) that, after investing in learning GatsbyJS for the past 1 year and publishing blog series and creating production websites, I am releasing a book on GatsbyJS.

The first part will contain beginners to intermediate stuff. So, it gives me immense pleasure to announce my first book, just got released.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
