Welcome to part-29 of the series. As i had added more blogs to my site, i found some more CSS issues which i will fixing next.

The first issue was that the tags were overflowing itâ€™s container.

I had pushed the code to github, which had deployed the site to netlify and fixed these issues.

This completes the part-29 of the series.
