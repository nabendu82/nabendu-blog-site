Welcome to part-18 of the series. Before moving forward, we need to do some CSS changes so that the Right Menu shows properly. We are mainly changing it from display: flex to display: block, so that it extends to the whole viewport in mobile menu.

So, change the file **RightMenu.styled.js** as below.
