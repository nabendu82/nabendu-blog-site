Welcome to part-16 of the series. We need to add Side Menu on the right side also. It will open on the clicking the hamburger menu, on the mobile screen.

But letâ€™s first change our only item in right menu to a component, as we need it at two places.

Create a new file **Advert.js** inside components folder and add the code from **index.js** in it.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Now, our Right Menu is also fully operational in the Mobile view.
