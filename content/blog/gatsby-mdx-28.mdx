Welcome to part-28 of the series. In this part i will start with adding the logic to show current count of total blogs, next to search bar. We will also update the count, if someone searches in search bar.

Open the **index.js** file and add a variable **postCount**, which will get the total count of posts. After that add a new state variable **filteredCount**.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

Itâ€™s time to push the code to github for the automatic deployment in netlify. And our site [thewebdev.tech](https://thewebdev.tech/) is live after the deployment.
