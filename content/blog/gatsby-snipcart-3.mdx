Welcome to part-3 of the series. We will start creating generic styled components here, so that we donâ€™t have to create different style in each project. Also, these styles are reusable in other part of the project.

So, create a folder **utils** inside **src** folder. Create a file **styles.js** inside it and the below content in it.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

The code is now working perfectly in localhost on click of the Menu button.
