Welcome to part-23 of the series. I will start this part by creating the About page, which is currently blank. Create a new folder **About** in **components** folder and a file **About.js** inside it.

I am putting the below content inside it. I am also reusing the styles from **contact.module.css** file.

![About.js](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1589903483/23-dev/1_eyibyq.png)*About.js*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

So, now each individual post will have different title.

One more task of adding twitter and facebook cards is remaining in this project, but we will do in the next part.

This completes part-23 of the series.

You can find the code for the same in [this](https://github.com/nabendu82/thewebdev-public) github repo.
