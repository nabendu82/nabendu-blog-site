Welcome to a brand new series, where we make a recipe sharing site using GatsbyJS and Firebase.

The idea of this site came during this COVID-19 lockdown. My wife is making some awesome and tasty dishes during this period. She takes help from popular youtube channels to prepare those dishes. So, this site will contain the nice real photo of the dish, prepared by my wife and the original youtube link. It will also have the comment section, for people to comment on each dish.

Let’s go ahead and create a new site by giving gatsby new recipes-homemade in the terminal.
