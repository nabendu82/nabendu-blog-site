Welcome to part-17 of the series. I want to have the concept of series in the site. Many of the blog posts are part of a series and i want to group them together, which will be easier for the user to find them.

First, i want to implement the click on logo, to take to home page. We can do this my wrapping the image tag with a Link tag, in **Navbar.js** file.

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
