Welcome to part-8 of the series. In this part we will start with our page transition, which will occur when we navigate to a different page.

For this we will be again using an awesome gatsby plugin and it is **gatsby-plugin-transition-link**. The doc link can be found [here](https://transitionlink.tylerbarnes.ca/docs/).

Now, as per the docs we need to npm install the plugin first. So, head over to your terminal and close **gatsby develop** if it is running. After that install the plugin through the terminal.

![npm install](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/8/1_4zK5sxT0iq.png)*npm install*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.
