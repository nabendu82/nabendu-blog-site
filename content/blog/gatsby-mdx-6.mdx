Welcome to part-6 of the series. In this part we will, first start with our GraphQL queries. So, head over to [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) but make sure gatsby develop is running in the terminal.

Here, we will first check our **allMdx** query by checking the **totalCount**. And it returns the right count.
