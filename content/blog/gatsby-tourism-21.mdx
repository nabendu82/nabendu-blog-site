Welcome to part-21 of the series. I had decided to put Advertisement in my site [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) which i had build in this series. I had newly learned to add Ads to a gatsby powered site and added it in my blog site [https://nabendu.blog/](https://nabendu.blog/). You can learn about it [here](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-blog-site-using-stackbit-gatsbyjs-and-dev-6-84dc6bd923d4).

I have the approval for media.net Ads. You can learn more about it [here](https://thewebdev.tech/blog-gatsby-stackbit-6). So, after login to the media.net console, need to click on

![media.net](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/GatsbyTourism/21/1_nG0qMQ421.png)*media.net*

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

After this i pushed my code to netlify and it got deployed. Now the Ads are live on [https://amazinghampi.com/](https://amazinghampi.com/) . Here you get both floating Ad and also text ads.
