Welcome to part-10 of the series. The first thing which we will do is to add the author details, which includes his twitter, github and dev account after every post.

We already had saved these fields in the frontmatter, so we need to first update the GraphQl query in **post-template.js**

Rest of the chapter is exclusive content and is from my book **Foundation Gatsby Projects**.

The book can be purchased from Apress site <a href="https://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484265574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

It will show all our tags in the home page, on the right sidebar.
