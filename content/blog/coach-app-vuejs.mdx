In this post we are going to create a fairly large VueJS app with authentication.

This project have been inspired by [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) awesome Udemy course by Maximillian.

To start with this project get the basic boiler plate of a VueJS app from [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_koqvIkGMj_U9Ffuwy_qCSbZlHjkuQeO/view) file.

After extracting the zip file, open the folder in terminal. Then do npm i to install all the dependencies.

Next, we will create a pages folder inside the src folder. And inside it create a coaches and requests folder. We will create different files in it and also a router.js file in the root directory.

In the router.js file, we will add different routes which will call different component. Also, notice the nested route which we have created.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129233/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/2_qhffuc.webp)

Next, in the main.js file we will add our router and App file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129230/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/3_gpygxa.webp)

Now, we will create a components folder and inside it TheHeader.vue file. This file will have a basic template of header with router-link.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129228/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/4_nq5ulv.webp)

Next, we will add the styles in TheHeader.vue file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129228/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/5_xkn3gq.webp)

Next, we will add TheHeader component in App.vue file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129224/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/6_y0lymd.webp)

Now, we will add a basic template in CoachRegistration.vue file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129223/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/7_q3ndwc.webp)

And a basic template in ContactCoach.vue file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129221/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/8_bbuopq.webp)

And a basic template in RequestsReceived.vue file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129220/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/9_vl8yzn.webp)

Next, in the CoachesList.vue file also, we will have a basic template.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129227/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/10_jqkmhb.webp)

Now, in http://localhost:8080/coaches we will see a nice header and other basic components.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129218/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/11_twtn6h.webp)

Now, we will introduce Vuex in our app for global state management. It is like Redux in ReactJS. So, create a store folder inside src and inside it modules folder.

Inside the modules folder create coaches and requests folder. Inside the coaches folder, we will create different files related to vuex. Also, we will have a index.js file in the modules folder.

In the index.js of the coaches folder, we will include all mutations, actions and getters.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129218/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/12_emjhbp.webp)

Next, in the root index.js file we will create a store and call the coachesModule. Notice, this concept is also similar to store in Redux.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129217/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/13_ifhimu.webp)

Back in the index.js of the coaches, we will have a namespace and also a state containing our coaches array.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129214/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/14_fekzlh.webp)

In the mutation.js file, we will export an empty object.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129213/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/15_vyyitx.webp)

In the actions.js file, we will export an empty object.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129211/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/16_ehwy9b.webp)

In the getters.js file we will get the state of coaches and check whether coach state is there, through two functions.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129211/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/17_z4hhmr.webp)

Back in our main.js file, we will add the store.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129209/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/18_lhbtcj.webp)

Now, in the CoachesList.vue file we will add a basic template which will get all our coaches and also use the hasCoaches using computed properties. We are using the coaches array to show all coach name now.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129208/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/19_isf6qs.webp)

We are now seeing the two coaches name and the buttons in localhost.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129207/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/20_hp1rhu.webp)

Next, we will have a CoachItem.vue file in which we will get the id, firstName, rate and areas as props.

We will also have a fullName, coachContactLink, coachDetailsLink in the computed properties.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129205/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/21_rpb0mi.webp)

Next, in the CoachesList.vue file, we will call the CoachItem component and pass different props.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129203/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/23_midlbk.webp)

Back in http://localhost:8080/coaches we will see all Coaches.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129202/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/24_brvalf.webp)

In the RequestsReceived.vue file we will use the RequestItem component and have the receivedRequests and hasRequests computed properties.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129137/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/69_tirlf5.webp)

Now, we can contact a coach and send a request.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129139/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/70_ieth3l.webp)

We can see the received requests.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129135/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/71_ehygvv.webp)

We forgot to add params in our ContactCoach.vue file. So, we will do the same.

Next, in CoachesList.vue file we show the Register as Coach button, if isCoach and isLoading is false. Also, the coach-item will be shown if hasCoaches is true.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129116/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/85_ioubvy.webp)

Next, we will create the BaseDialog.vue file where we will create a basic template with some styles.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129114/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/86_bg5nyd.webp)

Now, we will include the BaseDialog in the main.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129113/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/87_hzx95q.webp)

In the CoachesList.vue file, we will show this base-dialog in case of and error.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129111/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/88_uchhia.webp)

Now, we will make an error in the actions.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129110/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/89_vgkxl4.webp)

Now, in http://localhost:8080/coaches we will get the error pop-up.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129109/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/90_iwpwsc.webp)

Now, in the actions.js for requests, we will add a contactCoach function. This will take the email and message and make an POST call to requests in firebase.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129107/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/91_musvxx.webp)

Once, we submit a request to contact an Coach, it will be saved in the database.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751129106/27-Jun-25/coach-app-vuejs/92_uy2umg.webp)

Now, in the actions.js for requests, we will add a fetchRequests function. It will get all the data for requests from the databse and save it in the requests array.
