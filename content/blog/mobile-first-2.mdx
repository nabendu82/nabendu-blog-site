Welcome to part-2 of the series.

We will first add the basic css to our **style.css,** which is necessary for the primary color, reset and the body.

So, our site will look like below. Notice that we are creating the mobile layout first.

Next, we will create the style for the button and the button hover. We are also creating the style for the input and the textarea.
