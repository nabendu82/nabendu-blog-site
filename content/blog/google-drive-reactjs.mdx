In this post we are going to make a Google Drive clone using ReactJS. We will be also using firebase to store the files and for authentication.

Beside this we will be using styled components to style our project. This project have been inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BXU9qPGH2s&list=PL6aoYO5bSdyyiD11fYDA3OpZDXNxCHtFd&index=2) awesome series from Camel Coder.

We need to first create a new project with create-react-app called google drive from terminal.

Once the project is created, we will delete some of the boiler plate files.

Next, in index.js file we will delete the not required code and it will look like below.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019164/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/3_sxrtqc.webp)

Next, in App.js file we will delete the not required code and it will look like below.

We will also make all margin to 0 in the index.css file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019160/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/5_lwukcy.webp)

Now, run the project with npm start and it will look like below.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019159/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/6_bex6sv.webp)

Next, create a components folder inside src folder. And in it create a Header.js file. Next in the App.js file, we will include it.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019155/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/7_bhtixx.webp)

Now, in the Header.js file we will add the below styled components. We have also installed the package of styled-components in the integrated terminal.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019154/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/8_vyfylg.webp)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019029/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/56_xleeaz.webp)

Now, create a firebase.js file inside the src folder. And put the config from above in it.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019028/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/57_r99mlh.webp)

We will now add the boiler plate code to use firebase db, storage, auth and provider in firebase.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019024/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/58_h8460j.webp)

Now, we will have a Modal to be shown while uploading file. So, in Sidebar.js file we will import Modal from Material UI and also some styled components.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019023/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/59_x15ab7.webp)

We are going to have some more styles for ModalBody in Sidebar.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019019/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/60_ce8asb.webp)

Now, inside the Sidebar function, we will have a new state of open. And we will also show the modal with the styled components with two input.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019018/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/61_fpncyi.webp)

Now, our nice pop-up will be shown in localhost.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019014/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/62_vrowgy.webp)

When the user clicks Submit, we want to show a uploading text. For this we will have a styled component and an uploading state in the Sidebar.js file.

Now, we will show the uploading para if the uploading state is true or else the input buttons.

We have also given the onClick handler to the Sidebar button.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019013/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/63_kme2op.webp)

Now, we will add the main logic to upload a file in Sidebar.js file. First the onChange in input of file, will get the file selected.

Now, the handleUpload, which runs when we click the Submit button, will have the main logic.

Here, we are first using the storage code to upload the storage in firbase. After that we are using the uploaded file details to save the details of the file in firestore database.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019010/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/64_fbqm4b.webp)

We also need to have the imports of firebase in Sidebar.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019005/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/65_bnkb4h.webp)

Now, again go to localhost and upload a file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019008/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/66_zjuozs.webp)

Now, if we check the Storage we can see the file been uploaded.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019003/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/67_ctfs1b.webp)

We will also see the details of it in firestore database.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751019000/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/68_qy5oe6.webp)

Now, we also want to show these uploaded files. So, in the Data.js file we will first do the required imports.

After that we have a files state. Now from inside a useEffect, we are calling firebase databse and getting the array and setting it to files array.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018998/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/69_siyhdq.webp)

Now, we also need a function to change the size to KB, MB in the Data.js file. For this we have got a function from stack overflow.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018996/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/70_ylcmpv.webp)

Now, we will map through the file to show it in both folder format and in list in the Data.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018994/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/71_hzu1bb.webp)

Now, we will see the files in localhost.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018991/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/72_uonrqw.webp)

Now, we will also add Authentication in our project. So, we will add styles for the same first in App.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018989/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/73_ynsbuc.webp)

Now, we will use the signInWithPopup() method from firebase to login to the app. Here, we will login the login screen if we don’t find the user in App.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018988/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/74_ps4bn9.webp)

We will also use the new props of photoURL in the Header.js file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018985/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/75_gvwjwv.webp)

Now, when we go to the app for first time, we will see the login screen.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018983/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/76_ss24b5.webp)

Now, when we login through our gmail account we will see the photo of the logged in user also at the top right.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018981/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/77_l5ayfp.webp)

It’s time to deploy our app and make it live. So, go to the terminal and run firebase login

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018979/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/78_lbxdep.webp)

After that give firebase init command. Here use arrow key and press the spacebar to Hosting and after that press enter.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018977/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/79_asduhr.webp)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018973/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/81_gcfvcq.webp)

Next, we choose the public directory and it is build. The next option is Yes for single-page app and github deploys No.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018968/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/82_u9cdih.webp)

Now, we need to run npm run build in the terminal for a production optimal build.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018970/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/83_bvtffr.webp)

Now, the final command is firebase deploy to deploy the frontend to firebase.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkxvfo2o/image/upload/v1751018966/27-Jun-25/google-drive-reactjs/84_xvrgca.webp)
